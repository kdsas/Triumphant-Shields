# Triumphant-Shields
This is a PC multiplayer RPG about a village that has been invaded with a bunch of evil beings. The player must enter combat and defeat the evil beings which come in the form of other players and NPCs.

The player has a choice between four different combat weapons: sword, glaive, dagger, or Helios Sun Ball. Damage amounts vary between the different combat weapons, swords deliver the least bit of damage while Helios Sun Balls deliver the greatest amount of damage. All players start off with a sword, but as the player’s XP increases they have access to the throwable combat weapons, also known as skills. Once the player’s health points decrease to fifty or below, they automatically heal. The player has three times to heal before losing the game. Sword combat and healing are the only skills that require no XP to access. The XP values are strength, courage, and wisdom. Once you reach your XP goal, you go to the next level. To earn XP, you must accept quest challenges such as collecting certain inventory items, buying/selling items in the in-game store, or killing a certain amount of NPC enemies. The last person left on the game server wins the game and a shield. This game challenges the mind and provides combat conundrums for players to untangle.
